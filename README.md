# TextTech_project
This project is part of the **Text Technology** course at the University of Stuttgart. We build an end-to-end pipeline that scrapes book data, classifies genres using machine learning, and encodes metadata in XML using RelaxNG ‚Äî fulfilling the *collect‚Äìprepare‚Äìaccess* requirements and including a technical extension beyond lectures.

## üöÄ Project Overview

> A publishing platform wants to automatically classify new books by genre based on their descriptions. We help by scraping book data, training a genre classifier, and encoding the enriched metadata in structured XML format for archival, querying, and presentation.
